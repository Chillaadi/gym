	<h1 align="center" > Yoga As Exercise</h1>
<p>Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West,
 following the success of Swami Vivekananda in the late 19th and early 20th century with his adaptation of yoga tradition,
 excluding asanas. Outside India, it has developed into a posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique.
Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise; it has a meditative and spiritual core.
