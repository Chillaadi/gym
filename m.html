<h4>“Meditation provides a way of learning how to let go. ...</h4>
<h4>“Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.” – ...</h4>
<h4>“Meditation is not spacing-out or running away. ...</h4>
<h4>“Meditation is a vital way to purify and quiet the mind, thus rejuvenating the body.”</h4> 

<h4>If you want to find God, hang out in the space between your thoughts.</h4>

<h4>Words are but the shell; meditation is the kernel.</h4>

<h4>Through meditation, the Higher Self is experienced.</h4>

<h4>.Spirituality as a science, as a study, is the greatest and healthiest exercise that the human mind can have.</h4>

<h4>The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.</h4>
