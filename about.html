               Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports,
 occupations and daily activities. 
Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition,
 moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest.
The U.S. guidelines continue: Additional health benefits may be achieved by engaging in more than 300 minutes (5 hours)
 of moderate-intensity physical activity per week.
 Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are of moderate or greater intensity 
and involve all major muscle groups on two or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits
