	<h1 align="center" > Aerobics</h1>
<h4>Aerobics is a form of physical exercise that combines rhythmic aerobic exercise with stretching and strength training routines with the goal </h4>
<h4>of improving all elements of fitness (flexibility, muscular strength, and cardio-vascular fitness). It is usually performed to music and may be </h4>
<h4>practiced in a group setting led by an instructor (fitness professional), although it can be done solo and without musical accompaniment. </h4>
<h4>With the goal of preventing illness and promoting physical fitness, practitioners perform various routines comprising a number of different</h4>
 <h4>dance-like exercises. Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity and will have five components:</h4>
 <h4>warm-up (5–10 minutes), cardiovascular conditioning (25–30 minutes), muscular strength and conditioning (10–15 minutes)</h4>
<h4>cool-down (5–8 minutes) and stretching and flexibility (5–8 minutes)</h4>.
 <h4>Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation according to their fitness level.</h4> 
<h4>Many gyms offer a variety of aerobic classes. Each class is designed for a certain level of experience and taught by a certified</h4>
<h4> instructor with a specialty area related to their particular class. </h4>
